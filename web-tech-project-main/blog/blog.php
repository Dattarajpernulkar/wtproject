                <p>Candy has its origins mainly in Ancient India. Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the
                    Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the people in India and their "reeds that produce
                    honey without bees". They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture.[3] Sugarcane
                    is indigenous to tropical South and Southeast Asia, while the word sugar is derived from the
                    Sanskrit word sharkara.[4] Pieces of sugar were produced by boiling sugarcane juice in ancient
                    India and consumed as khanda, dubbed as the original candy and the etymology of the
                    word.[5][6][7][8][9]

                    Before sugar was readily available, candy was based on honey.[10] Honey was used in Ancient
                    China, the Middle East, Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire to coat fruits and flowers to
                    preserve them or to create forms of candy.[11] Candy is still served in this form today, though
                    now it is more typically seen as a type of garnish.

                    Before the Industrial Revolution, candy was often considered a form of medicine, either used to
                    calm the digestive system or cool a sore throat. In the Middle Ages candy appeared on the tables
                    of only the most wealthy at first. At that time, it began as a combination of spices and sugar
                    that was used as an aid to digestive problems. Digestive problems were very common during this
                    time due to the constant consumption of food that was neither fresh nor well balanced. Banquet
                    hosts would typically serve these types of 'candies' at banquets for their guests. One of these
                    candies, sometimes called chamber spice, was made with cloves, ginger, aniseed, juniper berries,
                    almonds and pine kernels dipped in melted sugar.[11]

                    The Middle English word candy began to be used in the late 13th century.[12][13]

                    The first candy came to America in the early 18th century from Britain and France. Only a few of
                    the early colonists were proficient in sugar work and sugary treats were generally only enjoyed
                    by the very wealthy. Even the simplest form of candy – rock candy, made from crystallized sugar
                    – was considered a luxury.[14]</p>
                <br>
                <p>he candy business underwent a drastic change in the 1830s when technological advances and the
                    availability of sugar opened up the market. The new market was not only for the enjoyment of the
                    rich but also for the pleasure of the working class. There was also an increasing market for
                    children. While some fine confectioners remained, the candy store became a staple of the child
                    of the American working class. Penny candies epitomized this transformation of candy. Penny
                    candy became the first material good that children spent their own money on. For this reason,
                    candy store-owners relied almost entirely on the business of children to keep them running. Even
                    penny candies were directly descended from medicated lozenges that held bitter medicine in a
                    hard sugar coating.[15]

                    In 1847, the invention of the candy press (also known under the surprising name of a toy
                    machine) made it possible to produce multiple shapes and sizes of candy at once. In 1851,
                    confectioners began to use a revolving steam pan to assist in boiling sugar. This transformation
                    meant that the candy maker was no longer required to continuously stir the boiling sugar. The
                    heat from the surface of the pan was also much more evenly distributed and made it less likely
                    the sugar would burn. These innovations made it possible for only one or two people to
                    successfully run a candy business.[14]</p>

                <p> Our Mutual Friend, January 7, 1885, satirical cartoon by Joseph Keppler, warning of the dangers
                    of color additives used in candy.
                    As the path from producer to market became increasingly complicated, many foods were affected by
                    adulteration and the addition of additives which ranged from relatively harmless ingredients,
                    such as cheap cornstarch and corn syrup, to poisonous ones. Some manufacturers produced bright
                    colors in candy by the addition of hazardous substances for which there was no legal regulation:
                    green (chromium oxide and copper acetate), red (lead oxide and mercury sulfide), yellow (lead
                    chromate) and white (chalk, arsenic trioxide).[16]

                    In an 1885 cover cartoon for Puck, Joseph Keppler satirized the dangers of additives in candy by
                    depicting the "mutual friendship" between striped candy, doctors, and gravediggers. By 1906,
                    research into the dangers of additives, exposés of the food industry, and public pressure led to
                    the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, the first federal United States law to regulate food
                    and drugs, including candy.[16]</p>
